# Lab-Derek README

This module creates six functions. Five that allow the array methods map, filter, reduce, concat, and splice to be used on any array-like object which has index values (including strings!) -- found on fp.js -- and one that prints all node bash echos in uppercase -- found on index.js.

It was a good exercise in test-driven development, forcing me to think through precisely what each of these array methods do and what arguments they accept. It also gave me some good practice working with process.argv in the CLI.

I won't explain what fp.map, fp.filter, etc. do as it should be self-explanatory -- they accept the same inputs as their counterparts on the Array.prototype and you can consult the docs for those.
